## Branching model

We follow [this branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) so make sure to read before contributing.
Master & Develop branches are protected and cannot be pushed too. Make sure your new branch has a related hotfix, feature or release prefix.
Also squash and rebase your commits before creating a pull request. See [always-squash-and-rebase-your-commits](https://blog.carbonfive.com/2017/08/28/always-squash-and-rebase-your-git-commits/).

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Rebase and squash your commits into one before creating a pull request, reword your
   commit message with details of changes made.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of another developer, if you
   do not have permission, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.
